    <!--STORY GOES HERE-->

  <p>  The Norway Maple tree is not a tree that is particularly native to New York state. However, after making its arrival in the late 1700’s, the tree has been planted all over the city. We learn very early on that trees provide us with the oxygen we need to survive. In return, we exhale carbon dioxide in the air. </p>

  <p>  Unfortunately, over the years as the human race continued to grow and develop new inventions and make new discoveries, this caused an increased amount of fossil fuels to be released into the atmosphere. Now presently, we are feeling the effects of climate change firsthand, causing some of us to take more direct action in fighting for our planet. </p>

  <p>  According to the National Park Service, “the changing climate increases stressors that weaken plant resilience, disrupting forest structure and ecosystem services. Rising temperatures lead to more frequent droughts, wildfires, and invasive pest outbreaks, leading to the loss of plant species.” </p>

  <p>  Gail King, 70, is one of the leaders at Extinction Rebellion NYC, a ‘radical’ climate change activist organization that specializes in hosting peaceful marches and protests all across NYC. </p>

  <p>  “I feel like my generation is to blame for the damage that the earth is facing now,” said King. “That’s why I feel obligated to do something about it.” </p>

  <p>  The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation is responsible for planting new trees, maintaining the ones already existing and removing any dead/old trees. </p>

  <p>  As the years progressed from 1995 to 2015, the borough of Queens has seen a dramatic change in the number of trees reported to be dead. I thought it would be interesting to highlight just how drastic that change was and show the connections it has to climate change. </p>
